App-ZofCMS-Plugin-Comments

The module is a plugin for L<App::ZofCMS>. It provides means to easily add
"visitor comments" to your pages. The plugin offers configurable
flood protection ( $x comments per $y seconds ) as well as ability to
notify you of new comments via e-mail. The "moderation" function is also
implemented, what that means is that you (the admin) would get two links
(via e-mail) following one of them will approve the comment; following the
other will simply delete the comment from the database.

I am an utterly lazy person, thus you may find that not everything you
may want to configure in the plugin is configurable. The plugin is
yet to undergo (at the time of this writing) deployment testing, as in
how flexible it is. If you'd like to see some features added, don't be shy
to drop me a line to C<zoffix@cpan.org> 

This documentation assumes you've read L<App::ZofCMS>,
L<App::ZofCMS::Config> and L<App::ZofCMS::Template>
